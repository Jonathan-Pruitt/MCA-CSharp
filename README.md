This repository holds the code examples Jonathan used for instruction during the 2024 CSharp module. 

It is an amalgamation of various examples of different coding elements (e.g. explaining variables, data types, functions, arrays, nodes, reference types v. value types, objects, etc)

The goal this repository was meant to accomplish was to give those whom I was instructing access to the code snippets while I was not personally available.
It is not meant to accomplish a task, nor is it well commented. 

In fact, if you're not one of the people I was instructing in Spring of 2024, you'd probably be able to keep your sanity intact better if you didn't bother looking at any of this code in the first place. Hahaha
